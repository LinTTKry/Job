# What is TS and why

* TypeScript is a **superset** of JavaScript&#x20;
* It extends JS, **introduces the concept of type** to JS, and adds many new features&#x20;
* **TS code needs to be compiled into JS** by a compiler, and then handed over to the JS parser for execution&#x20;
* TS is fully compatible with JS, in other words, **any JS code can be directly used as JS**&#x20;
* Compared with JS, **TS has a static type, stricter syntax, and more powerful functions**; TS can complete code inspection before code execution, reducing the chance of runtime exceptions; TS code **can be compiled For any version of JS code**, it can effectively solve the compatibility problem of different JS operating environments; for the same function, the amount of code in TS is larger than that of JS, but because the **code structure of TS is clearer** and **the variable types are more specific, it is in the maintenance of the later code TS is far better than JS**
